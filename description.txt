A beggining of decently large-scale Calamity Tweaks mod. 

For now, it's just a Supreme Cnidrion Boss. Designed for endgame Calamity equipment, currently in early alpha. Combine Amidas' Spark with 10 Shadowspec bars by hand and use it to summon the monstrosity.

If you want to help developing this mod or cringe at code quality, you're welcome. It is open-source and can be found at github.com/groomyjohny/CalamityTweaks
